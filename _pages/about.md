# About Me

Hi there 👋 — I'm Jacob, a Network Engineer and MSc Cybersecurity student from Kenya. I hold a First-Class Honours degree in Electrical and Telecommunications Engineering from Multimedia University of Kenya, and I’m currently building real-world experience through internships and lab work focused on enterprise networking, monitoring, and infrastructure.

## 🌍 What I Do

- ⚙️ **Network Engineering**  
  Experience with deploying, troubleshooting, and monitoring networks using tools like Nagios, Zabbix, Grafana, and OTDR. I’ve worked with Cisco and Ubiquiti equipment in both academic and enterprise environments.

- 🖥️ **Systems & Server Admin**  
  Comfortable working with Linux (Ubuntu, FreeBSD, Fedora), setting up servers, and managing virtual machines with VirtualBox. Currently learning Proxmox and exploring self-hosting for home labs and monitoring solutions.

- 🌐 **Internet Infrastructure & ISP Building**  
  Passionate about connectivity in Africa. I’m actively exploring how to start and register an ISP in Kenya, and how to provide reliable, affordable internet to education and research institutions (NRENs).

- 📹 **Content Creation**  
  Founder of **CivicStack_KE**, a YouTube channel breaking down tech policy in Kenya—starting with the proposed 2025 ICT Bill and the controversial ISP meter billing system.
