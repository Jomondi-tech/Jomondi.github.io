# üß™ Lab Challenges

As part of the **Cybershujaa Cloud and Network Security track**, I‚Äôve worked through a variety of hands-on labs that simulate real-world cybersecurity scenarios. These challenges have helped me sharpen my practical skills in network analysis, server security, and protocol understanding. Below are a few highlights.

## üåê Lab 1: HTB Academy ‚Äì Introduction to Network Traffic Analysis

**Problem Statement:**  
Learn how to analyze network traffic to identify and interpret key communication protocols and events, forming the foundation for threat detection and incident response.

**Approach:**  
- Completed the HTB Academy module on **Network Traffic Analysis**.
- Used **Wireshark** to inspect `.pcap` files capturing various types of network activity.
- Identified TCP three-way handshakes, DNS lookups, HTTP requests, and suspicious patterns (e.g., FTP logins, plaintext credentials).
- Applied filtering techniques (e.g., `http.request`, `tcp.stream eq 1`) to isolate relevant packets.

**Tools Used:**  
- Wireshark  
- HTB Academy Labs  
- Kali Linux (for optional analysis in terminal)  

**Screenshots:**  
*Include your own if applicable, e.g., packet filter views, credential capture, stream follow output*

**Key Lessons Learned:**  
- Developed fluency with Wireshark‚Äôs interface and filtering syntax.  
- Understood how attackers can be detected through traffic patterns and anomalies.  
- Learned to trace entire conversations (TCP streams) and reconstruct data flow.  
- Recognized the importance of network traffic analysis in SOC and blue team environments.

## üß™ Lab 2: Examine TCP/IP and OSI Models in Action

**Problem Statement:**  
To gain a deeper understanding of how the TCP/IP and OSI networking models operate in real-world scenarios by capturing and analyzing network traffic. The goal was to identify and map data flows to their corresponding layers and understand the interaction between protocols.

**Approach:**  
- Used **Wireshark** to capture live traffic on my local machine while browsing the web and using other network services.  
- Identified protocol types (e.g., Ethernet, IP, TCP, HTTP) and matched them to OSI layers.  
- Followed TCP streams to understand connection setup (three-way handshake), data transmission, and teardown.  
- Compared the TCP/IP model's 4 layers with the OSI model‚Äôs 7 layers using actual packet data.

**Tools Used:**  
- Wireshark  
- Mozilla Firefox / Chrome  
- Linux Terminal  
- Ping, Traceroute, and Netstat utilities  

**Screenshots:**

**Key Lessons Learned:**  
- Understood the real-time application of theoretical network models through packet analysis.  
- Mapped various protocols (e.g., ARP, DNS, TCP, HTTP) to OSI and TCP/IP model layers.  
- Gained hands-on experience in interpreting packet headers and payloads.  
- Reinforced how data encapsulation and de-encapsulation occur across layers during transmission.

## üß™ Lab 3: Use Wireshark to Examine Network Traffic

**Problem Statement:**  
To analyze and interpret raw network traffic using Wireshark, with the aim of understanding how data is transmitted over the network, identifying different types of packets, and correlating captured traffic with common protocols and services.

**Approach:**  
- Launched Wireshark and captured network traffic on my active network interface while performing common activities like web browsing, pinging, and accessing DNS.
- Applied filters to isolate specific protocols such as `icmp`, `dns`, `http`, and `tcp`.
- Inspected packet headers to examine source/destination IPs, ports, flags (like SYN, ACK), and payload data.
- Traced packet sequences to study connection initiation, data transfer, and session termination.

**Tools Used:**  
- Wireshark  
- Linux Terminal  
- Browser  
- ping, nslookup, curl, and netstat commands

**Screenshots:**

**Key Lessons Learned:**  
- Learned how to effectively navigate and filter traffic within Wireshark.  
- Understood the packet structure and key header information for TCP, UDP, and ICMP.  
- Gained confidence in correlating captured traffic with real-world activities like browsing or DNS resolution.  
- Recognized the importance of packet analysis in network troubleshooting and cybersecurity monitoring.
