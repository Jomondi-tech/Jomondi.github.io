## üß™ Linux Server Virtual Lab

**Context:**  
Conducted during my internship at KENET as part of setting up a hands-on network monitoring environment.

**Description:**  
Built a virtual lab using Oracle VirtualBox to simulate a production-like environment for system administration and monitoring.

**Tools & Technologies:**  
Oracle VirtualBox, Ubuntu Server, FreeBSD, Fedora, Nagios, Cacti

**Highlights:**  
- Installed and configured multiple Linux distributions in a virtual environment.
- Set up a network monitoring stack using Nagios and added real network equipment (AP and switch).
- Practiced core sysadmin skills including SSH, package management, cron jobs, and service monitoring.
- Set up open-source network monitoring tools deployed at KENET.

## üåê Examining TCP/IP and OSI Models in Action

**Context:**  
Completed in Week 1 of the Cybershujaa cybersecurity training program.

**Description:**  
Explored the practical implementation of the OSI and TCP/IP models through packet analysis using Wireshark.

**Tools & Technologies:**  
Cisco Packet Tracer, Wireshark, TCPDump, Linux CLI

**Highlights:**  
- Captured and analyzed packet exchanges between client and server.
- Mapped observed traffic to OSI layers (e.g., HTTP at Layer 7, TCP at Layer 4).
- Gained foundational insight into how protocols function in real network traffic.

## üöò Automatic Headlight Dimming for Vehicles

**Context:**  
My undergraduate final year project at Multimedia University of Kenya.

**Description:**  
Designed a smart headlight system that automatically dims based on oncoming traffic to improve driver safety and comfort.

**Tools & Technologies:**  
Arduino, LDR sensors, C/C++, Electronic circuitry

**Highlights:**  
- Implemented ambient light detection to automate headlight intensity.
- Designed and tested the prototype on a scaled model.
- Presented the project during the engineering showcase and received positive feedback from evaluators.
